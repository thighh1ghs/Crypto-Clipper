# Crypto Clipper ðŸ¦¾

A simple, lightweight clipboard monitor for cryptocurrency addresses. This tool monitors the system clipboard for any cryptocurrency address, and if detected, it replaces it with a specified label.

## Features ðŸ”‘

- **Monitors clipboard**: Tracks clipboard changes in real-time to detect cryptocurrency addresses.
- **Address Recognition**: Supports popular cryptocurrency addresses such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and more.
- **Clipboard Replacement**: Replaces detected cryptocurrency addresses with custom labels like "BTC Address", "ETH Address", etc (change with your own addresses).
- **Self-installation**: Installs itself in the userâ€™s `AppData` directory and ensures it starts with Windows.
- **Single Instance**: Ensures only one instance of the program runs at a time using a mutex.
- **Low Resource Consumption**: The application is designed to be lightweight and uses minimal system resources, making it ideal for running silently in the background.
- **Discreet Operation**: Operates in the background without noticeable impact on the userâ€™s experience. It is designed to be stealthy, and when obfuscated, it can bypass most security software (including Windows Defender).
- **Automatic Sleep Mode**: The application automatically pauses clipboard monitoring after a period of inactivity (e.g., no mouse movement or clipboard activity for a set duration), reducing unnecessary resource consumption.
- **Telegram Notification**: Sends a notification to a specified Telegram chat whenever the clipper is opened, providing real-time updates on its status.
